# API Codealong

This codealong uses the [astros api](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/) to fetch details about people who are currently in space and print their name and what craft they're on into the DOM.

It also quickly mentions installing [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh) to make viewing JSON in chrome a little easier.
